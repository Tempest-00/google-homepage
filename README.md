8/8/21
	re-started up, completed a bit of it (just html and a bit of css) and am currently working on orienting the html elements correctly. I'd previously worked with (ul)s for header/footer items and am having trouble getting my skills back to working order.

8/19/21 
	Having more trouble than expected (of course;), taking today to review html and CSS basics in free code camp, with an emphasis on flexbox and flex grid.

9/9/2021
	Decided to just fully dive in using mainly flex, and a couple other arrangements of things, including float, and just simply padding etc for spacing things apart.

	Project completed today
